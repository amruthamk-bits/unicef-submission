Objective from DATA science prospective: To aid & streamline process in schools, particularly Rural Government Schools

We hope to address a number of issues and problems with our Learning Experience Platform (LXP) bundled with Data Science and Machine Learning. Most of the data consolidation will be done through our LXP, along with some gevernment agencies & NGOs.

We have to first get our heads around the fact that to justify the solutions we are providing, we will need to follow the trend related to the students profiles for a substantial period, of at least 3 years. So, right now, we can only do the implementation & cannot provide any sort of conclusions. To get an idea of the dataset and backup my claims, we will first do a descriptive analytics before the prediction system.

Dataset as reference : Khajipalem ZPHS, Pittalavanipalem (Guntur District, AP) Student information dataset. 

Pre-requisites before algorithm implementation : Dataset should be balanced, missing values should be suitably replaced (either with the mode or the mean) and outliers corrected.

We will be considering a number of scenarios where machine learning can be implemented. Only one is represented here.

Summary of the ML model represented: We have undertaken field visits to the above mentioned school and conducted an extensive survey of the students. We have tried to capture the interests of students to continue to college (after 10th grade) and career goals.The copy includes Random Forest (For prediction and feature selection) & Naive Bayes (for prediction using only selected features). Visualisation of the results has not been at this point due to the large number of features. Also, the dummy/interactive variables have been created in another code and it is not included to avoid confusion.This predictive analysis will aid the stakeholders in future skill development and motivation of students towards progression of education.

We have planned many further innovations/programmes and have a passionate team to ensure implementation on the ground.

Thank you.
